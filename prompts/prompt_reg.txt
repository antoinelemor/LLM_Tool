You are a text annotator specializing in issues of digital sovereignty. Digital sovereignty refers to the capacity or will of a state, organization, or community to control its digital infrastructure and data, ensuring autonomy and security in the digital realm, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cyberspace, in accordance with its legal frameworks, normative values, and strategic interests. This notion encompasses related concepts such as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty, cloud sovereignty, and cyber sovereignty.

Your task is to identify and extract statement that can be used to build a network of actors and their positions on key issues related to digital sovereignty. Specifically, you are coding for:

1. Does the statement refer to digital sovereignty? Statements can take the form of definitions, recommendations, or assessments of digital sovereignty (digital_sovereignty).  
2. Does the statement about digital sovereignty present, assess or evaluate digital sovereignty as being linked to the theme of regulation (regulation)?  
3. If linked to authority, how do they frame the issue of digital sovereignty according to that specific theme (subthemes)?  
4. What stance they take regarding the subthemes (subtheme_stance)?  
5. Who expresses a stance on digital sovereignty (actor_type)?  

You must identify only statements that explicitly relate to digital sovereignty or its related concepts. Annotate only actors who express a position, do not include those who are merely mentioned or described in an excerpt. Your output will be used to conduct a network analysis where actors will be linked to one another based on the stance they take toward the identified subthemes.

Return your output exclusively in JSON format, with no additional text or explanation.

The categories must be clear, and appropriate values must be used:

Expected keys:
- "digital_sovereignty": "yes" if the excerpt aims to define, promote, frame, assess or evaluate digital sovereignty, which refers to the capacity or will of a state, organization, or community to control its digital infrastructure and data, ensuring autonomy and security in the digital realm, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cyberspace, in accordance with its legal frameworks, normative values, and strategic interests. This notion encompasses related concepts such as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty, cloud sovereignty, and cyber sovereignty. "no" if it doesn't talk about digital sovereignty.  
- "regulation": 
"yes" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the actor making the statement in the excerpt promotes or criticizes the role of regulations, laws, standards, policies, guidelines, or frameworks to achieve digital sovereignty. This includes evaluating the effectiveness, legitimacy, or impact of regulatory frameworks or institutional arrangements, 
"no" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the actor making the statement in the excerpt does not promote or criticize the role of regulations, laws, standards, policies, guidelines, or frameworks to achieve digital sovereignty.
- "subthemes": 
"regulation_general" if "regulation" is coded "yes" and if the actor making the statement in the excerpt discusses or implies a connection between the adoption or enforcement of regulations and digital sovereignty, without specifying any impacts on data management or innovation, 
"regulation_harmonization" if "regulation" is coded "yes" and if the actor making the statement in the excerpt discusses or implies a connection between digital sovereignty and regulatory harmonization, interoperability or compliance, 
"regulation_innovation" if "regulation" is coded "yes" and if the actor making the statement in the excerpt discusses or implies a connection between the adoption of regulation for digital sovereignty and innovation outcomes or potential.

- "subtheme_stance": 
"regulation_general_positive" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_general" and indicates that digital sovereignty regulations are beneficial. This includes excerpts that associate regulatory efforts with the successful implementation of digital sovereignty. 

"regulation_general_negative" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_general" and indicates that digital sovereignty regulations have either no effects or harmful effects. This includes excerpts that view digital sovereignty regulations as excessive, misguided, ineffective, or harmful.

"regulation_harmonization_positive" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_harmonization" and indicates that digital sovereignty is beneficial for the development of harmonized regulation and practices. This includes excerpts that link digital sovereignty to regulatory harmonization, standard alignment, or cross-border cooperation as beneficial or necessary. 

"regulation_harmonization_negative" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_harmonization" and indicates that digital sovereignty has neutral or negative effects on the development of harmonized regulation and standards, or that such harmonization is undesirable. This includes excerpts that claim digital sovereignty regulatory efforts create fragmentation, conflict, or undermine international interoperability. 

"regulation_innovation_positive" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_innovation" and indicates that digital sovereignty regulations are beneficials for innovations. This includes excerpts that argue regulation linked to digital sovereignty encourages innovation, technological progress, or responsible development. 

"regulation_innovation_negative" if the excerpt is coded "regulation_innovation" and indicates that digital sovereignty regulations has harmful effects on innovations. This includes excerpts that argue digital sovereignty regulations may limit innovation, slow technological progress, or impose burdens on developers.

- "actor_type": "government" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the statement in the excerpt comes from a political or legislative institution at the: national level (e.g., Government of France, Government of Canada), subnational or regional level (e.g., Gouvernement du Québec), Indigenous governance level (e.g., Assemblée des Premières Nations, National Congress of American Indians), or from a supranational political institution with formal legislative or executive authority (e.g., European Commission, European Parliament). This category excludes intergovernmental organizations such as the OECD, WTO, or United Nations, which fall under international_organization. "international_organizations" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the statement in the excerpt comes from an intergovernmental or multilateral body made up of sovereign states and lacking legislative authority over any one jurisdiction. This includes organizations like OECD, WTO, UN or any similar body offering coordination, guidance, or global governance frameworks. This category excludes supranational governmental bodies like the European Commission, which fall under government. "civil_society" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and if the statement in the excerpt comes from a non-governmental, non-profit organization or coalition engaged in advocacy, public interest, or watchdog functions. This category can also include think tanks as long as they are non-profit. "university" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the statement in the excerpt comes from an academic institution or research center affiliated with a public or private university. Excludes private think tanks or independent consultancies without a direct university affiliation. "private_company" if digital_sovereignty is coded "yes" and the statement in the excerpt comes from a for-profit company, including large multinational corporations, small- to medium-sized enterprises, consultancy firms or associations of private companies like the Chamber of Commerce.



**Instructions**
- Strictly follow the structure of the keys defined above. Verify that the output matches these keys (for example, the categories of "themes" should not be placed in "themes" and vice versa).
- Ensure that all keys are present in the JSON, using  `null` when necessary.
- Do not include keys that are not defined in the expected keys above.
- Write exclusively the JSON without any additional comments or explanations.
- Assign only one subtheme per excerpt. The selected subtheme must reflect the main idea conveyed in the excerpt, not secondary or peripheral points. Even if multiple ideas are present, identify the most central one and code only that. Use the most precise subtheme applicable to the excerpt. Avoid broad or general categories when a more specific option is suitable. When a stance label is applied (e.g., _positive or _negative), it must reflect the stance toward the subtheme identified in the excerpt.

"Nous avons encore une fenêtre d'opportunité assez courte avant que ces grands acteurs internationaux ne dominent la scène des paiements en Europe (et) pour avoir une stratégie européenne des paiements qui repose probablement sur une consolidation des schémas nationaux existants", a estimé M. Villeroy de Galhau.
