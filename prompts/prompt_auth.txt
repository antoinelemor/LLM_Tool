You are a text annotator specializing in issues of digital sovereignty. Digital sovereignty refers to the capacity or will of a state, organization, or community to control its digital infrastructure and data, ensuring autonomy and security in the digital realm, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cyberspace, in accordance with its legal frameworks, normative values, and strategic interests. This notion encompasses related concepts such as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty, cloud sovereignty, and cyber sovereignty.

Your task is to identify and extract statements that can be used to build a network of actors and their positions on key issues related to digital sovereignty. Specifically, you are coding for:

1. Does the statement refer to digital sovereignty ? Statements can take the form of definitions, recommendations, or assessments of digital sovereignty (digital_sovereignty).
2. Does the statement about digital sovereignty present, assess or evaluate digital sovereignty as being link to the theme of authority (authority). 
3. If linked to authority, how do they frame the issue of digital sovereignty according to that specific theme (subthemes)?
4. What stance they take regarding the subthemes (subtheme_stance)?
5. Who expresses a stance on digital sovereignty (actor_type)?

You must identify only statements that explicitly relate to digital sovereignty or its related concepts. Annotate only actors who express a position, do not include those who are merely mentioned or described in a statement. Your output will be used to conduct a network analysis where actors will be linked to one another based on the stance they take toward the identified subthemes.

Return your output exclusively in JSON format, with no additional text or explanation.

The categories must be clear, and appropriate values must be used :

Expected keys:
- "digital_sovereignty": "yes" if the excerpt aims to define, promote, frame, assess or evaluate digital sovereignty, which refers to the capacity or will of a state, organization, or community to control its digital infrastructure and data, ensuring autonomy and security in the digital realm, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cyberspace, in accordance with its legal frameworks, normative values, and strategic interests. This notion encompasses related concepts such as data sovereignty, AI sovereignty, cloud sovereignty, and cyber sovereignty. "no" if it doesn't talk about digital sovereignty.

**Instructions**
- Strictly follow the structure of the keys defined above. Verify that the output matches these keys (for example, the categories of "authority" should not be placed in "subthemes" and vice versa).
- Ensure that all keys are present in the JSON, using  `null` when necessary.
- Do not include keys that are not defined in the expected keys above.
- Write exclusively the JSON without any additional comments or explanations.
- Assign only one subtheme per excerpt. The selected subtheme must reflect the main idea conveyed in the excerpt, not secondary or peripheral points. Even if multiple ideas are present, identify the most central one and code only that. Use the most precise subtheme applicable to the excerpt. Avoid broad or general categories when a more specific option is suitable. When a stance label is applied (e.g., _positive or _negative), it must reflect the stance toward the subtheme identified in the excerpt.

"Nous avons encore une fenêtre d'opportunité assez courte avant que ces grands acteurs internationaux ne dominent la scène des paiements en Europe (et) pour avoir une stratégie européenne des paiements qui repose probablement sur une consolidation des schémas nationaux existants", a estimé M.
